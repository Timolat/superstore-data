Customer Segmentation and Sales Prediction Analysis
________________________________________
# Overview / Introduction 
This project aims to analyze supermarket sales data to understand customer purchase behavior and predict total sales using machine learning techniques. The motivation behind this analysis is to help businesses optimize their sales strategies, personalize marketing efforts, and enhance customer satisfaction. The key research questions include:
•	What are the key characteristics of customer purchasing patterns?
•	How can customers be segmented based on their purchasing behavior?
•	Can we build a predictive model to estimate total sales based on available data?

# Data Collection & Description
•	Source: Supermarket sales dataset for kaggle
•	Dataset Structure: Contains multiple rows representing transactions with attributes such as Unit Price, Quantity, Tax, and Total Purchase Value.
•	Key Variables: 
o	Unit Price: Cost per unit of the product.
o	Quantity: Number of units purchased.
o	Tax 5%: Applicable tax.
o	Total: Final purchase value after tax.
•	Preprocessing Steps: 
o	Removed missing values and duplicates.
o	Standardized column names for consistency.
o	Converted data types where necessary.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Summary Statistics: 
o	Mean, median, standard deviation of Unit Price, Quantity, Total.
•	Visualizations: 
o	Histograms and box plots to analyze distributions.
o	Correlation heatmap to understand relationships between variables.
o	Scatter plots to explore trends between Total and other numerical features.
•	Key Insights: 
o	Higher quantity purchases tend to correlate with higher total sales.
o	Certain product categories show higher sales frequency.

# Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
•	Handling Outliers: Used box plots to detect and remove extreme values.
•	Missing Data: No significant missing values were found.
•	Feature Engineering: 
o	Created a Total Purchase column.
o	Standardized numerical variables using scaling techniques.

# Methodology / Approach
•	Techniques Used: 
o	Descriptive statistics to analyze purchase behavior.
o	Clustering (K-Means) for customer segmentation.
o	Linear Regression for predicting total sales.
•	Model Selection: 
o	K-Means clustering to segment customers.
o	Linear Regression due to its interpretability and effectiveness in sales prediction.

# Data Analysis / Modeling
•	Tools Used: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
•	Model Training: 
o	Train-test split (80%-20%).
o	Implemented Linear Regression using scikit-learn.
•	Performance Metrics: 
o	R² Score: Measures how well the independent variables explain the variance in the dependent variable.
o	Mean Squared Error (MSE) for error analysis.

# Results & Interpretation
•	Key Findings: 
o	The model achieved a strong R² score, indicating a good fit.
o	Customer segmentation identified three main groups based on spending behavior.
o	Higher unit prices and quantities strongly correlate with total sales.
•	Business Implications: 
o	Personalized marketing strategies for different customer segments.
o	Stock optimization based on purchase trends.

#	Summary of Findings: 
o	Clear customer segments identified.
o	Linear Regression effectively predicts total sales.

 # Challenges & Limitations
•	Data Quality Issues: Some minor inconsistencies in column formatting.
•	Model Limitations: 
o	Linear Regression assumes a linear relationship, which may not fully capture all purchase patterns.
